# Build a cute animal gallery
For this assignment you will be building on your cute bunny directive assignment. You will need to create three different photo albums of cute animals. These could kittens, puppies, goats, sugar gliders, lemurs, whatever as long as it's cute and an animal, preferably mamilian and fuzzy. You will need to create a photo album directive that contains a title and description of your album, an array of pictures to display and whether or not you're currently displaying the text, thumbnail or a full size image. This last switch should determine which display directive is currently loaded in the album directive.

For a bonus point add another 'list' directive, for example a carousel directive. You could also create a vote tracker for the animal in each of the albums.

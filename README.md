# Build a cute animal gallery
For this assignment you will be building on your cute bunny directive assignment. 

Create three different photo albums of cute animals. These could kittens, puppies, goats, sugar gliders, lemurs, whatever as long as they are ridiculously cute and animals, preferably mammalian and fuzzy. 

You will need to create a photo album (think of it as an image collection) directive that contains:

 - a title and description of your album
 - an array of pictures to display
 - and a "Display Mode" UI control to toggle whether or not you're currently displaying images in a table view or grid view 

The Display UI control should determine which image display directive is utilized for each photo within the album directive. Table view corresponds to the text-only directive, and the grid view is built with the thumbnail directive.

When a user clicks a table row or a thumbnail image, then replace the list view with your full-size image directive. Be sure to include a way to click back to the previously selected list view. 

## Bonus point
For a bonus point, add another 'album' directive to power a photo carousel (rotate through full-size display of the photos in the album, on a 3 second timer).
